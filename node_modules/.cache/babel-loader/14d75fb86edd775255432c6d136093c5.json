Our\n          custom lambda authorizer will take this token and will validate and\n          decrypt it. The lambda authorizer will retrieve information about the\n          token from the database and compare this data with the API request\n          information which would be used on internal-facing Hackney services\n          that also include their group information.\n          The lambda authorizor is configured to map the API\n          name along with the allowed Google groups for it. After the token is\n          successfully validated and the data from it is read (email and Google\n          groups the user belongs to), the Lambda function assumes the\n          LBH_Api_Gateway_Allow_GET IAM role in the account, where the API is\n          deployed. This is so the API ID received as part of the request can be\n          mapped to the actual API name.\n        </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We would like to reuse the auth token set by the frontend authentication\n        flow when users are signing in by passing it to a custom Lambda\n        authorizer and using the information stored within the token for\n        authentication purposes. The Lambda authorizer then queries DynamoDB to\n        check if a record for the given API exists. If yes, the Google groups\n        allowed to access the API are retrieved. The authorizer will then check\n        what Google Group the client is in and verify if they’re in one of the\n        allowed groups. Once the user/client has been authenticated,\n        authorization can be handled at the API level to ensure the user/client\n        has access to the requested resource. An AWS IAM policy statement is\n        returned indicating whether the request was authorized or not, and then\n        depending on the result either the requested Lambda resource is called\n        or the client gets an unauthorized response.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Implementing authorization this way requires a bit more development work\n        since this authorization layer introduces logic responsible for\n        determining which parts/subsets/fields of data from a given data domain\n        a user should have access to. For example, we envision that all notes\n        recorded by multiple service areas will be saved within the same data\n        store and served by the same microservice, but the microservice must\n        have a mechanism to filter and return only data that a user should have\n        access to\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        For example : If a user is a housing officer, they should not be able to see\n        notes generated by social care. However, an advantage of this is that it\n        removes the necessity to manage API keys in the infrastructure.\n        Furthermore, this business is empowered to manage their own resources\n        and determine who has access to them which gives them more flexibility.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n\n  );\n};\n\nexport const HomePage7 = () => {\n  return (\n    <div id=\"setting-up-api-authenticator\" className=\"main-container\">\n      <h2> How to set up your API Authenticator </h2>\n      <h4> Adding the authenticator to serverless</h4>\n      <p>\n        To add the Lambda Authorizer to serverless you would need to call it in\n        the serverless.yml file\n      </p>\n      <img src={arn} alt=\"\" className=\"center\"></img>\n      <p>\n        The API authenticator arn must be included since it links to the\n        api-authenticator lambda function which would require anyone calling the\n        API to provide a JWT token that would only be accepted if the user is in\n        any of the allowed Google Groups.
