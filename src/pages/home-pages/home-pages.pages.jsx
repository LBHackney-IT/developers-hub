    <h3>Why you might need an API?</h3>
        <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Sharing your data - Secure, structured and real-time access to data can be provided by an API. </li>
        <li>Data integrity - Providing a single source of data in the same format means more consistency across different systems. </li>
        <li>Integrations - APIs can provide links between different back end systems. </li>

        <h2> Our Ways of Working</h2>

        <p>All HackIT developed code should meet the <a href= "https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/Hackney-Development-Standards">12 Hackney Development Standards.</a>
           Our Team ensures that HackIT APIs are consistent,supportable and of high quality at all times.</p>

         <p>All newly created HackIT APIs will be developed using the guidelines in the HackIt API playbook.
            It provides clear guidance on the standards that are being followed when developing new APIs
            and is also used whenever amending old APIs that were created prior to the existence of the Playbook.
            Both of these guides are constantly evolving over time alongside technological changes.</p>

export const HomePage5 = () => {

    <div id="api-authentication" className='main-container'>
      <h2> Api Authentication </h2>

      <p>Authentication involves identifying/verifying who is requesting access to your api whilst authorization is determining the degree of access that is available for the user, i.e. verifying what specific files, applications, data the user can access.</p>
      
      <p>When a consumer makes a request to an API, Each consumer should provide their access token in an Authorization header when making a request. Our custom lambda authorizer will take this token and will validate and decrypt it. The lambda authorizer will retrieve information about the token from the database and compare this data with the API request information.</p>
      <p>A second authentication flow that we have implemented was produced for internal staff members. This solution leverages Google SSO as it enables users to log in to the Google hackney domain and generates a JWT following a successful login, which would be used on internal-facing Hackney services that also include their group information. 
      This solution maps the API name along with the allowed Google groups for it. After the token is successfully validated and the data from it is read (email and Google groups the user belongs to), the Lambda function assumes the LBH_Api_Gateway_Allow_GET IAM role in the account, where the API is deployed. This is so the API ID received as part of the request can be mapped to the actual API name.
      </p>
      <p>We would like to reuse the auth token set by the frontend authentication flow when users are signing in by passing it to a custom Lambda authorizer and using the information stored within the token for authentication purposes. The Lambda authorizer then queries DynamoDB to check if a record for the given API exists. If yes, the Google groups allowed to access the API are retrieved. The authorizer will then check what Google Group the client is in and verify if theyâ€™re in one of the allowed groups. Once the user/client has been authenticated, authorization can be handled at the API level to ensure the user/client has access to the requested resource. An AWS IAM policy statement is returned indicating whether the request was authorized or not, and then depending on the result either the requested Lambda resource is called or the client gets an unauthorized response.</p>
